                        a personal website: resume, portfolio, projects, and other miscellanea
***

_**resume**_:  
-
the latest version can be found [here](https://app.box.com/s/u7oxc33fjrroewypys8ynn92knxzbxxs).

_**portfolio**_: 
-
 i would suggest perusing my github repositories [example-work]() and [scripts]().   
if your looking for a collection of finished map products, [here]() is where you may find some produced with esri software.

_**projects**_: 
-
  

- [ ] have at least one git commit per day for a year
- [ ] build out a fancier version of this website from scratch with the Bootstrap framework
- [ ] become more familiar with the jekyll site-generating system
- [ ] make some maps for the portfolio using some python modules (folium/bokeh) using [earth observatory]() or [city of austin]() data
- [ ] make some gif timelapses using GDAL (need to find the video i watched on this)
- [ ] try to do at least a semi-challenging python coding problem per week
- [ ] shoot under 90 at my local golf course (~95 currently)
- [x] learn markdown making this site
