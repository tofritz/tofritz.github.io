-

the latest version can be found [here](https://app.box.com/s/u7oxc33fjrroewypys8ynn92knxzbxxs).

 i would suggest perusing my github repositories [example-work](https://github.com/tofritz/example-work) and [scripts](https://github.com/tofritz/scripts).
if you're looking for a collection of finished map products, [here](https://github.com/tofritz/example-work/tree/master/Maps) is where you may find some produced with esri software.

- [ ] build out a fancier version of this website from scratch with the Bootstrap framework
- [ ] become more familiar with the jekyll site-generating system
- [ ] make some maps for the portfolio using some python modules (folium/bokeh) using [earth observatory](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/what-is-eonet) or [city of austin](http://austintexas.gov/department/gis-and-maps/gis-data) data
- [ ] make some gif timelapses using GDAL (need to find the video i watched on this)
- [ ] try to do at least a semi-challenging python coding problem per week
- [ ] shoot under 90 at my local golf course (~95 currently)
- [x] - learn `markdown` by making this site
