One of the first projects that is encountered in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum is to attempt to recreate the www.google.com homepage. This project is part of the `Web Dev 101` course and is intended to be hands-on introduction to basic `HTML` and `CSS` syntax and structure.

The current version of my attempt to mimic the Google Search homepage can be found on this [page](https://tofritz.github.io/google-homepage) of my website. I found myself restarting from scratch after my first two attempts. The struggles in each attempt helped me rethink how to structure the `HTML` of the website to make styling via `CSS` simpler by using `class` for broad formatting of elements within a section and `id` attributes for specific elements.

I have gotten my version to a good facsimile of the original. I think I will also attempt the suggested follow-up exercise of trying to reproduce the search results page. 

Another thing I want to attempt is implementing a simple javascript button element that mimics the "I'm Feeling Lucky" hover feature of scrolling through a list of different variations of "I'm Feeling (...)" string. I have seen some examples of this implemented by using a `ul` element that is randomly transformed a certain set distance from the initial `li` to a later `li` to mimic the scrolling effect.
