One of the first projects that is encountered in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum is to attempt to recreate the www.google.com homepage. This project is part of the `Web Dev 101` course and is intended to be hands-on introduction to basic `HTML` and `CSS` syntax and structure.

The current version of my attempt to mimic the Google Search homepage can be found on this [page](https://tofritz.github.io/google-homepage) of my website. I found myself restarting from scratch after my first two attempts. The struggles in each attempt helped me rethink how to structure the `HTML` of the website to make styling via `CSS` simpler by using `classes` for broad formatting of elements within a section and `id` attributes for specific elements.

I have gotten the main search homepage to a good facsimile of the original.
