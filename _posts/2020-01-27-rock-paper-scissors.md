The next deliverable in the `Web Dev 101` course of my Odin Project curriculum is a simple implementation of the game 'rock, paper, scissors' in Javascript. Due to my previous experience with Python, I did not run into any problems conceptually with this exercise. However, it was a useful method for learning the differences in syntax and code formatting that comes with Javascript. Additionally, this led to more exposure to the console and built-in debugging utlities found in Chrome Dev Tools.

The code can be found in my `rock-paper-scissors` repository [here](https://github.com/tofritz/rock-paper-scissors).
