This is just some sample text which I will expound upon further when I finish tweaking this project.

The [`calculator`](https://www.github.com/tofritz/calculator) repository houses the code which is hosted live [here](https://tofritz.com/calculator). See if you can break my calculator --- I'm sure there are a few ways to accomplish that. Let me know what you find out. I think I've already found one (try hitting the plus/minus operator after hitting some operator buttons).
