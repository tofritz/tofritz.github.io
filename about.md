_**resume**_
-

The latest version can be found [here](https://app.box.com/s/u7oxc33fjrroewypys8ynn92knxzbxxs).

_**portfolio**_
-

The best way to see what I am up to would through my posts of the [home page](https://tofritz.github.io). I suggest perusing my github [repositories](https://github.com/tofritz?tab=repositories) to see the details of the things I am working on and have done in the past. I would suggest looking in `example-work` for various deliverables I've produced. If you're interested in seeing some finished map products, you can see some [here](https://github.com/tofritz/example-work/tree/master/pennstate-maps) that were produced with ESRI software during my GIS certification.

_**goals**_
-

- [ ] have at least one git commit ~~per day~~ per week for a year
- [ ] build out a fancier version of this website from scratch with the Bootstrap framework
- [ ] make some maps for the portfolio using some python modules (folium/bokeh) using [earth observatory](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/what-is-eonet) or [city of austin](http://austintexas.gov/department/gis-and-maps/gis-data) data
- [ ] make some gif timelapses using GDAL (need to find the video I watched on this)
- [ ] try to do at least a semi-challenging coding problem per week
- [ ] shoot under 90 at my local golf course (~95 currently)
- [ ] make this current website mobile-friendly
- [x] become more familiar with the jekyll site-generating system
- [x] learn `markdown` by making this site (and figure out why these checkboxes render correctly [here](https://github.com/tofritz/tofritz.github.io) but not [here](https://tofritz.github.io/about))
